## About me

I'm in my second year at BSUIR. I have no work experience. Now my priority is to become a JS Frontend developer and get a job. At the moment I'm taking a course from RS School, at the same time I'm studying the language on my own with the help of foreign video tutorials. I am goal-oriented and quick to grasp on the fly. I took a responsible approach to choosing a programming language to study. Therefore, learning something new for me is not a problem - on the contrary, it promotes me to my cherished goal - to become a JS developer. As the saying goes: 
> Find a job you enjoy doing, and you will never have to work a day in your life.

A large number of simple tasks have been solved, such as the one below.
```
// Square Every Digit
function squareDigits(num){
 let result = 0;
 let sqr = num.toString().split('');
 for (let i = 0; i < sqr.length; i++) {
   sqr[i] = sqr[i] ** 2;
 }
 result = sqr.join('');
 result = parseInt(result);
 return result;
}
```
